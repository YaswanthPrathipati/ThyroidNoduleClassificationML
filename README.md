# ThyroidNoduleClassificationML
Tumorous growths appearing in different places of the body are a defining feature of cancer, a fatal illness for which there is no known therapy. A common kind of cancer called thyroid cancer develops when nodules of malignant cells appear inside the tissues of the thyroid gland. Due to their tiny size or immature stage of development, these nodules are solid or liquid-filled masses that are difficult to classify as benign or malignant, which frequently results in neglect by medical professionals. Occasionally, the nodules may get huge, making it simpler to identify and classify them as malignant, but regrettably, this frequently denotes an advanced stage of the disease. Cancer may now be diagnosed effectively thanks to contemporary technologies. Computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) methods extract key information and categorise whether a patient has a tumour or cancer using Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) scores and different denoising and preprocessing procedures. SVM and ANN models are built and evaluated in order to assess the performance of CAD systems; SVM turns out to be the more effective model. In conclusion, while treating cancer remains a difficult task, modern medical innovations like computer-aided design (CAD) tools and powerful machine learning algorithms have increased our capacity to do so, enabling more efficient management and better patient outcomes.
